# Data Science projects

### Here are the projects that I completed during the course of the Yandex Practicum on the Data Science program

#### **All projects are done in Python in Jupyter Notebook.**

**The data was provided by Yandex Practucum as .csv files, as well as data received through SQL (PostgreSQL) queries from Yandex Practicum databases.**

**Libraries used:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, PySpark, Plotly Express, Seaborn, NLTK, PyTorch, PyTorch-Transformers, Tensorflow, Keras

**Models used:** LightGBM,  LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, DummyRegressor,

## Projects:
- [Car price valuation model](https://github.com/Andrey-Kosov/Projects/tree/main/car_price_valuation_model) . 
  - **Key points:** Gradient boosting, Gradient descent, Data Preprocessing, Cross-validation
  - **Libraries used:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Plotly Express, Seaborn
  - **Models reviewd:** LightGBM, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestRegressor, CatBoostRegressor
