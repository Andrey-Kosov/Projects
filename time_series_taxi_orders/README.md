# Predicting the number of taxi orders

### To attract more drivers during peak periods, we need to predict the number of taxi orders, using historical data on taxi bookings at airports.


- **Key points:** Time series: Resampling, Rolling mean, Trends, Seasonality, Residuals, Time series differences, Machine Learning
- **Libraries used:** Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Plotly Express, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy
- **Models reviewed:** AutoReg, CatBoostRegressor, LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, RandomForestRegressor
